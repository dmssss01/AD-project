### Problem Statement
Finding the Shortest Route in a Transportation Network

Suppose we have to work on a transportation management system that needs to find the shortest route for a delivery vehicle to travel from one location to another in a complex network of roads or routes. To solve this problem, we can implement Dijkstra's algorithm. This algorithm can help find the shortest path between the source and destination locations.

In this scenario, we can represent each location as a node in the graph, and the roads or routes as edges between the nodes. The weight of each edge can represent the distance, travel time, or any other relevant metric to the transportation network.

By inputting the source and destination locations into the project, it can calculate and display the shortest path for the delivery vehicle to follow. This can help optimize the delivery route and minimize travel time or distance.
